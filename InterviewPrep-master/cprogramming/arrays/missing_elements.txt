Q : Given an array with positive integers. All the number occurs even number of times except one. Find the number occuring odd number of times:
Ans : XOR all the elements. The result will be the number that is occuring odd number of times.

Q: Given n-1 number in the range of 1 .. n. Find the missing number.
Ans :   1. Find the sum of given number and subtract it from the sum of (1,n).
	2. XOR all the give elements= X1. XOR all the number from 1 - n = X2. XOP X1 and X2 to get the answer.

Q: 2 Repeating elements in n+2 given in the range of 1..n.
Ans:  5 methods are possible.
	1. Two loops.
	2. count array, since we know the range
	3. Sum and product
	4. XOR the given elements and 1..n. give X xor Y.
	   Get some set bit in the X xor Y.
	   Divide the given numbers into two sets based on this set bit.  S1 and S2
	   Divide the number 1..n into two sets based on the this set bit. T1 and T2
	   S1 xor T1 gives one number and  S2 xor T2 gives the other.
	5. Use the index for marking instead of count array in the second method
	  if (arr[abs(arr[i]) > 0)
		arr[abs(arr[i])] = -arr[abs(arr[i])]
	  else:
	  	abs(arr[i]) is repeated

Q: Given an unsorted array of size n. Array elements are in range from 1 to n. One number from set {1, 2, â€¦n} is missing and one number occurs twice in array. Find these two numbers
Ans: same 5 methods as in the above array
	1. One additional method is to sort the elements.
