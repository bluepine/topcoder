HCS Bootcamp: Technical Interview Workshop
==========================================

Presented by Kenny Yu, Harvard Computer Society

Contents:
* `resources.pdf` - Contains interview tips and strategies and links resources
* `problems.pdf` - List of problems
* `workshop.pdf` - Problems to work on during the workshop

DISCLAIMER: I compiled these problems mainly through searching online and CS124. Your interview preparation should not be limited to this list. It is simply to give you a flavor of the kinds of problems you might see in an interview.
