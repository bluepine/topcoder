techinterviewprep: A repository of code I wrote to prepare for a technical interview 

About

================================================================================================

Most of the high-tech companies (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Yahoo) today have technical interviews 
in their hiring process.

These interviews are used to measure the skills of the applicant and include real time coding problems.
Many of these problems include basic Computer Science concepts like data structures and algorithm 
complexity analysis.

Since I have graduate a few years ago I wrote some code to refresh the concepts. I created this repo 
to maintain this code I wrote. I focused in remember the concepts I learned at college given the short 
time I have to prepare for the interview, so the implementations are rough and are not efficient at all. 
I share the code only because I already wrote it and maybe someone will find it useful.

For every topic I created a subdirectory, this topis are:

1- Sorting algorithms
2- Data structures
3- Strings manipulation
4- Math problems (mostly from eulerproject)
5- Unix system programming
