When the Topcoder competitions started, I competed regularly.  For the
first year or so that I competed, I kept all my solutions.  I've long 
since stopped competing and can no longer keep those old solutions.  
I recently decided that it would be good practice to revisit those old
programming problems, and so I'm planning to keep my solutions here.
