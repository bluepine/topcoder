The original file is unicode.  Rather than deal with unicode, I'll
simply convert it to ascii.

To convert from unicode to ascii:
iconv -f utf-8 -t ascii -c  filename.in > filename.out


To run gdb in full screen mode, use:
gdb -tui <program name>

To dump the file in hex.
od -A x -t x1z -v tiny.txt

oprofile package or gprof
