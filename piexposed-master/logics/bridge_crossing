-- Question --

A party of four travelers comes to a rickety bridge at night. The bridge can hold the weight of at most two of the travelers at a time, and it cannot be crossed without using a flashlight. The travelers have one flashlight among them. Each traveler walks at a different speed: The first can cross the bridge in 1 minute, the second in 2 minutes, the third in 5 minutes, and the fourth takes 10 minutes to cross the bridge. If two travelers cross together, they walk at the speed of the slower traveler.

What is the least amount of time in which all the travelers can cross from one side of the bridge to the other?

-- Solution --

Crossing the bridge means that two travelers need to go with the flashlight and one of them returns it back. The most logical arrangement is to have 1 doing all the roundtrips:

Round 1: 1 + 2  => 2mn
Round 2: 1      => 1mn
Round 3: 1 + 5  => 5mn
Round 4: 1      => 1mn
Round 5: 1 + 10 => 10mn
                  ------
                   19mn

There is a better arrangement actually. One optimization would be to minimize the cost of sending 5 & 10 over. If we send them together that will cost us 10mn instead of 15mn.

Round 1: 1 + 2  => 2mn
Round 2: 1      => 1mn
Round 3: 10 + 5 => 10mn
Round 4: 2      => 2mn
Round 5: 1 + 2  => 2mn
                  ------
                   17mn
