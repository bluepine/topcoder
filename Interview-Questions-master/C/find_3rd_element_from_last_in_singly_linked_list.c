/*
    How do you find 3rd element from last in single pass?
*/

/*

Explanation:
    This can be solved by using 2 pointers, start second 
pointer when first pointer reaches third place. So when the 
1st pointer reaches the end of the list, the second will reach 
to the 3rd element from the last of the singly list.
