/*
    Inorder Tree Traversal without recursion and without stack!
*/

/*
    Explanation:
1. Initialize current as root 
2. While current is not NULL
   If current does not have left child
      a) Print currentâ€™s data
      b) Go to the right, i.e., current = current->right
   Else
      a) Make current as right child of the rightmost node in current's left subtree
      b) Go to this left child, i.e., current = current->left

Although the tree is modified through the traversal, it is reverted back to its 
original shape after the completion. Unlike Stack based traversal, no extra 
space is required for this traversal.
