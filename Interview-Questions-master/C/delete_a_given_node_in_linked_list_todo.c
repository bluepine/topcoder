Given only a pointer to a node to be deleted in 
a singly linked list, how do you delete it?

The solution to this is to copy the data from 
the next node into this node and delete the 
next node!. Ofcourse this wont work if the 
node to be deleted is the last node. Mark it 
as dummy in that case. If you have a Circular 
linked list, then this might be all the more 
interesting. Try writing your own C program to 
solve this problem. Having a doubly linked 
list is always better.
