Different stes of TCp connection:
===================================
1. LISTEN represents waiting for a connection request from 
          any remote TCP and port.
2. SYN-SENT represents waiting for a matching connection 
            request after having sent a connection request.
3. SYN-RECEIVED represents waiting for a confirming connection 
                request acknowledgment after having both received 
                and sent a connection request.
4. ESTABLISHED represents an open connection, data received 
               can be delivered to the user. The normal state
               for the data transfer phase of the connection.
5. FIN-WAIT-1  represents waiting for a connection termination 
               request from the remote TCP, or an acknowledgment 
               of the connection termination request previously sent.
6. FIN-WAIT-2 represents waiting for a connection termination 
              request from the remote TCP.
7. CLOSE-WAIT represents waiting for a connection termination 
              request from the local user.
8. CLOSING    represents waiting for a connection termination 
              request acknowledgment from the remote TCP.
9. LAST-ACK   represents waiting for an acknowledgment of the 
              connection termination request previously sent to the 
              remote TCP (which includes an acknowledgment of its 
              connection termination request).
10. TIME-WAIT represents waiting for enough time to pass to be sure 
              the remote TCP received the acknowledgment of its 
              connection termination request.
11. CLOSED    represents no connection state at all.

A TCP connection progresses from one state to another in response 
to events. The events are the user calls,OPEN, SEND, RECEIVE, CLOSE, 
ABORT, and STATUS; the incoming segments, particularly those containing
the SYN, ACK, RST and FIN flags; and timeouts.
