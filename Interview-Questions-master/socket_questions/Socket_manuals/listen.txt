LISTEN(2)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                 LISTEN(2)



NAME
       listen - listen for connections on a socket

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>          /* See NOTES */
       #include <sys/socket.h>

       int listen(int sockfd, int backlog);

DESCRIPTION
       listen()  marks  the socket referred to by sockfd as a passive socket,
       that is, as a socket that will be used to accept  incoming  connection
       requests using accept(2).

       The  sockfd  argument  is a file descriptor that refers to a socket of
       type SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_SEQPACKET.

       The backlog argument defines the maximum length to which the queue  of
       pending  connections  for  sockfd  may  grow.  If a connection request
       arrives when the queue is full, the client may receive an  error  with
       an  indication of ECONNREFUSED or, if the underlying protocol supports
       retransmission, the request may be ignored so that a  later  reattempt
       at connection succeeds.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is
       set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EADDRINUSE
              Another socket is already listening on the same port.

       EBADF  The argument sockfd is not a valid descriptor.

       ENOTSOCK
              The argument sockfd is not a socket.

       EOPNOTSUPP
              The socket is not of a type that supports the  listen()  opera‚Äê
              tion.

CONFORMING TO
       4.4BSD,  POSIX.1-2001.   The  listen() function call first appeared in
       4.2BSD.

NOTES
       To accept connections, the following steps are performed:

           1.  A socket is created with socket(2).

           2.  The socket is bound to a local address using bind(2), so  that
               other sockets may be connect(2)ed to it.

           3.  A willingness to accept incoming connections and a queue limit
               for incoming connections are specified with listen().

           4.  Connections are accepted with accept(2).

       POSIX.1-2001 does not require the inclusion of <sys/types.h>, and this
       header  file is not required on Linux.  However, some historical (BSD)
       implementations required this header file, and  portable  applications
       are probably wise to include it.

       The behavior of the backlog argument on TCP sockets changed with Linux
       2.2.  Now it specifies the queue  length  for  completely  established
       sockets  waiting  to  be accepted, instead of the number of incomplete
       connection requests.  The maximum length of the queue  for  incomplete
       sockets can be set using /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_max_syn_backlog.  When
       syncookies are enabled there is no logical  maximum  length  and  this
       setting is ignored.  See tcp(7) for more information.

       If   the   backlog   argument   is   greater   than   the   value   in
       /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn, then it is silently  truncated  to  that
       value;  the  default  value  in  this  file is 128.  In kernels before
       2.4.25, this limit was a hard coded value, SOMAXCONN, with  the  value
       128.
