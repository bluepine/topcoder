SHUTDOWN(2)               Linux Programmer's Manual               SHUTDOWN(2)



NAME
       shutdown - shut down part of a full-duplex connection

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/socket.h>

       int shutdown(int sockfd, int how);

DESCRIPTION
       The  shutdown() call causes all or part of a full-duplex connection on
       the socket associated with sockfd to be shut down.  If how is SHUT_RD,
       further  receptions  will  be  disallowed.  If how is SHUT_WR, further
       transmissions will be disallowed.  If how is SHUT_RDWR, further recep‚Äê
       tions and transmissions will be disallowed.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is
       set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EBADF  sockfd is not a valid descriptor.

       ENOTCONN
              The specified socket is not connected.

       ENOTSOCK
              sockfd is a file, not a socket.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, 4.4BSD (the shutdown() function call first  appeared  in
       4.2BSD).

NOTES
       The  constants  SHUT_RD,  SHUT_WR,  SHUT_RDWR  have the value 0, 1, 2,
       respectively, and are defined in <sys/socket.h> since glibc-2.1.91.
