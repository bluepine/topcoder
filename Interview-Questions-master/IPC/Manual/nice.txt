NICE(2)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                NICE(2)



NAME
       nice - change process priority

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       int nice(int inc);

   Feature    Test    Macro    Requirements    for   glibc   (see   fea‐
   ture_test_macros(7)):

       nice(): _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       nice() adds inc to the nice value for the  calling  process.   (A
       higher  nice value means a low priority.)  Only the superuser may
       specify a negative increment, or priority  increase.   The  range
       for nice values is described in getpriority(2).

RETURN VALUE
       On success, the new nice value is returned (but see NOTES below).
       On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EPERM  The calling process attempted to increase its priority  by
              supplying  a negative inc but has insufficient privileges.
              Under Linux the CAP_SYS_NICE capability is required.  (But
              see  the  discussion  of the RLIMIT_NICE resource limit in
              setrlimit(2).)

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.  However, the Linux and (g)libc (ear‐
       lier  than  glibc  2.2.4) return value is nonstandard, see below.
       SVr4 documents an additional EINVAL error code.

NOTES
       SUSv2 and POSIX.1-2001 specify that nice() should return the  new
       nice  value.   However,  the Linux syscall and the nice() library
       function provided in older  versions  of  (g)libc  (earlier  than
       glibc  2.2.4)  return  0  on  success.  The new nice value can be
       found using getpriority(2).

       Since glibc 2.2.4, nice() is implemented as  a  library  function
       that  calls  getpriority(2)  to  obtain  the new nice value to be
       returned to the caller.  With this implementation,  a  successful
       call  can  legitimately  return -1.  To reliably detect an error,
       set errno to 0 before the call, and check its value  when  nice()
       returns -1.
