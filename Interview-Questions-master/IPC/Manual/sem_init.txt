SEM_INIT(3)             Linux Programmer's Manual            SEM_INIT(3)



NAME
       sem_init - initialize an unnamed semaphore

SYNOPSIS
       #include <semaphore.h>

       int sem_init(sem_t *sem, int pshared, unsigned int value);

       Link with -lrt or -pthread.

DESCRIPTION
       sem_init()  initializes  the  unnamed  semaphore  at  the address
       pointed to by sem.  The  value  argument  specifies  the  initial
       value for the semaphore.

       The  pshared  argument  indicates whether this semaphore is to be
       shared between the threads of a process, or between processes.

       If pshared has the value 0, then the semaphore is shared  between
       the  threads  of a process, and should be located at some address
       that is visible to all threads (e.g., a  global  variable,  or  a
       variable allocated dynamically on the heap).

       If  pshared is nonzero, then the semaphore is shared between pro‐
       cesses, and should be located in a region of shared  memory  (see
       shm_open(3),  mmap(2), and shmget(2)).  (Since a child created by
       fork(2) inherits its parent's memory mappings, it can also access
       the  semaphore.)   Any  process that can access the shared memory
       region  can  operate  on   the   semaphore   using   sem_post(3),
       sem_wait(3), etc.

       Initializing  a  semaphore  that  has  already  been  initialized
       results in undefined behavior.

RETURN VALUE
       sem_init() returns 0 on success; on error, -1  is  returned,  and
       errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EINVAL value exceeds SEM_VALUE_MAX.

       ENOSYS pshared  is  nonzero,  but  the  system  does  not support
              process-shared semaphores (see sem_overview(7)).

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       Bizarrely, POSIX.1-2001 does not specify the value that should be
       returned by a successful call to sem_init().  POSIX.1-2008 recti‐
       fies this, specifying the zero return on success.
