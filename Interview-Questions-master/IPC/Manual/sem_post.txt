SEM_POST(3)             Linux Programmer's Manual            SEM_POST(3)



NAME
       sem_post - unlock a semaphore

SYNOPSIS
       #include <semaphore.h>

       int sem_post(sem_t *sem);

       Link with -lrt or -pthread.

DESCRIPTION
       sem_post()  increments (unlocks) the semaphore pointed to by sem.
       If the semaphore's value consequently becomes greater than  zero,
       then another process or thread blocked in a sem_wait(3) call will
       be woken up and proceed to lock the semaphore.

RETURN VALUE
       sem_post() returns 0 on success; on error, the value of the sema‚Äê
       phore  is  left  unchanged,  -1  is returned, and errno is set to
       indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EINVAL sem is not a valid semaphore.

       EOVERFLOW
              The maximum allowable  value  for  a  semaphore  would  be
              exceeded.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       sem_post() is async-signal-safe: it may be safely called within a
       signal handler.

EXAMPLE
       See sem_wait(3).
