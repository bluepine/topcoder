PTHREAD_DETACH(3)       Linux Programmer's Manual      PTHREAD_DETACH(3)



NAME
       pthread_detach - detach a thread

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_detach(pthread_t thread);

       Compile and link with -pthread.

DESCRIPTION
       The  pthread_detach()  function  marks  the  thread identified by
       thread as detached.   When  a  detached  thread  terminates,  its
       resources  are  automatically released back to the system without
       the need for another thread to join with the terminated thread.

       Attempting to  detach  an  already  detached  thread  results  in
       unspecified behavior.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  pthread_detach() returns 0; on error, it returns an
       error number.

ERRORS
       EINVAL thread is not a joinable thread.

       ESRCH  No thread with the ID thread could be found.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       Once a  thread  has  been  detached,  it  can't  be  joined  with
       pthread_join(3) or be made joinable again.

       A   new   thread  can  be  created  in  a  detached  state  using
       pthread_attr_setdetachstate(3) to set the detached  attribute  of
       the attr argument of pthread_create(3).

       The detached attribute merely determines the behavior of the sys‐
       tem when the thread terminates; it does not  prevent  the  thread
       from being terminated if the process terminates using exit(3) (or
       equivalently, if the main thread returns).

       Either pthread_join(3) or pthread_detach() should be  called  for
       each thread that an application creates, so that system resources
       for the thread can be released.  (But note that the resources  of
       all threads are freed when the process terminates.)

EXAMPLE
       The following statement detaches the calling thread:

           pthread_detach(pthread_self());
