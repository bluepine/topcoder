PTHREAD_SETSCHEDPRIO(3) Linux Programmer's ManualPTHREAD_SETSCHEDPRIO(3)



NAME
       pthread_setschedprio - set scheduling priority of a thread

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       pthread_setschedprio(pthread_t thread, int prio);

       Compile and link with -pthread.

DESCRIPTION
       The  pthread_setschedprio() function sets the scheduling priority
       of the thread thread to the value specified in  prio.   (By  con‐
       trast pthread_setschedparam(3) changes both the scheduling policy
       and priority of a thread.)

RETURN VALUE
       On success, this function returns  0;  on  error,  it  returns  a
       nonzero  error  number.   If  pthread_setschedprio()  fails,  the
       scheduling priority of thread is not changed.

ERRORS
       EINVAL prio is not valid for the scheduling policy of the  speci‐
              fied thread.

       EPERM  The caller does not have appropriate privileges to set the
              specified priority.

       ESRCH  No thread with the ID thread could be found.

       POSIX.1-2001 also documents an ENOTSUP ("attempt was made to  set
       the    priority    to    an   unsupported   value")   error   for
       pthread_setschedparam(3).

VERSIONS
       This function is available in glibc since version 2.3.4.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       For a description of the permissions required to, and the  effect
       of,  changing  a thread's scheduling priority, and details of the
       permitted ranges for priorities in each  scheduling  policy,  see
