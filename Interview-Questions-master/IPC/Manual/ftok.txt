FTOK(3)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                FTOK(3)



NAME
       ftok  - convert a pathname and a project identifier to a System V
       IPC key

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <sys/ipc.h>

       key_t ftok(const char *pathname, int proj_id);

DESCRIPTION
       The ftok() function uses the identity of the file  named  by  the
       given pathname (which must refer to an existing, accessible file)
       and the least significant  8  bits  of  proj_id  (which  must  be
       nonzero)  to generate a key_t type System V IPC key, suitable for
       use with msgget(2), semget(2), or shmget(2).

       The resulting value is the same for all pathnames that  name  the
       same  file,  when  the  same value of proj_id is used.  The value
       returned should be different when the  (simultaneously  existing)
       files or the project IDs differ.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, the generated key_t value is returned.  On failure -1
       is returned, with errno indicating the error as for  the  stat(2)
       system call.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       Under libc4 and libc5 (and under SunOS 4.x) the prototype was:

              key_t ftok(char *pathname, char proj_id);

       Today proj_id is an int, but still only 8 bits are used.  Typical
       usage has an ASCII character proj_id, that is why the behavior is
       said to be undefined when proj_id is zero.

       Of  course  no guarantee can be given that the resulting key_t is
       unique.  Typically, a best  effort  attempt  combines  the  given
       proj_id  byte,  the  lower  16  bits of the inode number, and the
       lower 8 bits of the device number into a 32-bit  result.   Colli‚Äê
       sions  may  easily happen, for example between files on /dev/hda1
       and files on /dev/sda1.
