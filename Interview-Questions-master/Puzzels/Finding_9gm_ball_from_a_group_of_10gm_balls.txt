Q.
	There are 10 bags each containing 10 balls weighing 10 grams each, 
but one bag has balls containg 9 grams.We are given 1 rupee coin 
and allowed to weigh only once. How will we find the odd one out.
Sol:
	Label the bags 1 through 10. Take 1 ball from bag 1, label it 1. 
Take 2 balls from bag 2, label both 2. Take 3 balls from bag 3, 
label each 3. Take 4 balls from bag 4, label each 4. Continue this 
with bags 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Put all 55 balls on the scale. If 
all 55 balls weighed 10 grams each, the scale would read 550 grams. 
Subtract the number on the scale from 550. The answer will tell you 
the number of the bag with the lighter balls. Example, if the scale 
reads 547, it's bag #3. If the scale reads 542, it's bag #8.
