General Overview of Layer 2
============================

Layer 2 is Data Link Layer (DLL) as per OSI Model. As we 
know function of each layer is to provide services to above 
layer, so DLL provide various services to Layer 3: Network Layer. 
Various services which DLL provides are:
1. Framing network layer data packets.
2. Flow Control
3. Multiple Access control using CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense 
   Multiple Access / Collision Detection) in wired network and 
   CSMA / CA (Collision Avoidance) in wireless network.
4. Physical Addressing
5. Switching
6. Quality of Service (QoS)
7. Virtual LAN’s (VLAN)


Data Link Layer is basically divided into two sub-layers:
1. Logic Link Control (LLC): Provide services to upper layer.
2. Media Access Control (MAC): Perform Layer 2 functions like 
   switching, physical addressing etc.

Basically what I am going to explain in this article is, 
how inter-communication happens in data network between two 
devices at Layer 2 (Switching).

Physical Addressing and Switching
===================================
 

Network is a group of devices connected to each other. On 
Layer 2, devices can communicate within a single network only. 
Layer 2 devices cannot span multiple networks, for multiple 
networks Layer 3 support is required.  Each device in a single 
network needs to be identified uniquely. At Layer 2, unique 
identification is done via physical addressing scheme. Device 
hardware (NIC Card) which provides interconnection has unique 
physical address assigned to it known as MAC Address. MAC address 
is of 48 bits, written in hexadecimal form separated after 8 
bits with either colon (:) or hyphen (-). Example address: 
00:80:48:5C:1A:52. So each machine will have unique physical 
address by which machine is identified. Total MAC Address is of 
6 bytes. Each manufacturer is allotted with first 3 bytes of 
MAC Address which act as series prefix for all the NIC’s by 
that company, last 3 bytes are unique within one series. By this 
way no MAC address of one company can clash with another nor 
within company series.  Communication among devices at layer 
2 is done via some interconnecting device, which forms connection 
between each host machine or network devices (router, wireless, etc). 
Switch is that device which provides interconnection. Switch has 
ports (physical interface) at which wires from various network 
devices or host machines connect. All devices in a network are 
connected to a switch which interconnects them; this is Layer 1 
(inter-connection).  Now let’s get into deep understanding about 
how communication is done after interconnection. For this we 
need to understand working of switch.

Working of Switch
==================
 

Switch is an interconnecting device with 16 or 24 ports in common. 
All other devices are connected to these ports. Whenever any machine 
sends packet to any other machine, source machine send packet to 
switch, switch then forwards it to destination machine. Each packet 
which comes to switch contains source and destination physical 
address in it, on basis of which switch forwards packet to other 
machine. Switch always sent packet based on destination MAC address. 
Its process is as follows: (process also known as Switching)

    When switch receives a packet from any device, it checks for 
    its destination MAC address.
    Then switch compares destination MAC address with its MAC 
    Address Table for corresponding MAC address.
           
        If MAC Address is found, packet is sent out to port against 
        which MAC Address was matched.
           
        If entry is not found for that MAC address, ARP Request is 
        generated. (Is explained below).
               

Now question comes, how does switch knows on which port destination 
machine is connected? For this switch uses one table in its cache 
memory called MAC Address table or Forwarding Table in which switch 
stores that at which port which machine is connected by storing its 
physical address (MAC Address). So table contains two columns 
(Physical Address and Port Number) and rows equal to number of ports 
in switch.  When switch is turned ON, by default there is no entry 
in MAC address table, as communication starts, based on devices 
involved entries are created in table. Switch uses ARP 
(Address Resolution Protocol) for filling table for unknown hosts 
on switch ports.

Working of Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
============================================
 
ARP is a layer 2 protocol, used for obtaining MAC address of any 
devices within a network. Not only switch but also host machines use 
ARP protocol to obtain MAC Address. ARP protocol in conjunction 
with Layer 3 IP Protocol addressing (IP Address).  Host machine 
uses ARP because when machine needs to send packet to another 
device, destination MAC address is needed to be written in packet 
sent, so host machine should know the MAC Address of destination 
machine. Operating Systems also maintain ARP Table (MAC Address Table).  
To obtain MAC address, ARP performs following process: (ARP request 
by host machine)

    Source machine generate ARP REQUEST packet with source MAC address 
(of this machine), source IP address (of this machine) and destination 
IP address and forwards this packet to switch.
    Switch receives the incoming packet and reads the source MAC 
address and checks its MAC address table, if entry for packet at 
incoming port is found then it checks its MAC address with the source 
MAC address and updates it, if entry not found then switch add and 
entry for incoming port with MAC address.
    All ARP REQUEST packets are broadcasted in network, so switch 
broadcast ARP REQUEST packet in network.
    (Broadcast are those packets which are sent to everyone in 
network except the sender, only in network to which it belongs, 
it cannot span multiple networks)
    All devices in network receives ARP packet and compare their 
own IP address with the destination IP address in that packet.
    Only the machine which matches the both will reply with ARP 
reply packet. This packet will have source IP of this machine 
(which was destination machine in previous packet, as now its 
replying this machine will be the source machine) , source MAC 
address, destination MAC address (same as source MAC address in 
REQUEST packet) and destination IP address (same as source IP 
address in REQUEST packet).
    Then switch reads the ARP reply message and add entry in its 
MAC Address Table for port number on which it has received packet 
by reading its source MAC address field and forwards that packet 
to destination machine (source machine in REQUEST packet) as its 
MAC is in destination MAC address.
    Further host machine add destination machine entry into its ARP table.

This using ARP resolution switch and other devices in network 
obtain MAC address of any other device in a network. Remember 
ARP works on broadcast, so it works only in single network.

Final Layer 2 Communication Process
======================================
 Now finally let’s see how devices communication occur at Layer 2.  
Example Newtork Suppose Machine A needs to communicate with Machine 
D, following will be the process at Layer2:
 
Summary Process
================

    Machine A lookup’s for Machine D MAC address in its ARP table.
    If MAC Address found then packet is formed and sent to Switch A.
    If MAC address not found then ARP Request is generated and MAC 
    address is obtained.

    Switch A receives packet and checks for MAC Address in its MAC 
    Address Table.

    If MAC Address matched it will forward packet on matched port number.
    If MAC Address not found then it will generate ARP Request and 
    obtain MAC Address and port number on which it is connected and 
    sent out packet for that port.

    Machine D receives packet from Switch A which was sent by Machine A.
    When Machine D will reply, same process will be followed as 
    switching is done.

 

 
Detailed Process
=================

    Machine A lookup’s for Machine D MAC address in its ARP table. 
If MAC address is not found, machine A will send ARP Request for 
MAC address of machine D (using Machine D IP Address) and sends 
packet of Switch A.
    Switch A will receive and read packet and add Machine A physical 
address in its MAC Address table to which Machine A is connected.
    After that, switch will broadcast ARP Request packet in network.
    All machines in network except Machine A will receive ARP Request 
packet. Then all machines will check for Destination IP address and 
compare with its own IP Address.
    Only Machine D IP address matches with destination IP address 
as packet was intended for that machine.
    Machine D will reply with its MAC Address (as per ARP working).
    Switch A receives ARP Reply packet, and will add physical address 
of Machine D in its MAC Address table against corresponding port on 
which it received request.
    After adding entry it will check for destination MAC Address and 
compare it with its MAC address table.
    Based on MAC Address table entry, it will forward packet to 
corresponding port number against which successful match was found.
    Host machine will receive ARP Reply and add MAC address to its ARP table.
    Then machines forms complete data packet and sends it to Switch A.
    Switch A receives packet and updates it’s MAC Address Table 
and based on Destination MAC Address match with its MAC Address 
Tables, forwards packet on corresponding port.
    In same manner other machine will reply and same process will 
repeat as point 12 and 13.
