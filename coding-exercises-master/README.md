## Coding-Exercises

Coding-Exercises is not a proper project. Is more like a _box_ in which I'd like
to leave the solution to various exercises that I do in my spare time (if any).

Exercises can be of any kind: most notorious [CompSci](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Science)
problems and less notorious, more [interview-ish](http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=software+engineering+interview&btnG=Search&meta=&aq=f&oq=) ones.

If by any chance I happen to be your interviewer,
this material could be very helpful. ;-)

## Contributions? More then welcome

Of course I'm more then open to contributions and, most probably,
corrections and improvements.
I'm not a genius and I would actually love to read some code to learn from
my mistakes. *So feel free to fork*.

## What's in this repo?

The list started small, but in few days I did covered some ground.
Most of the problems are simple, but
*the aim is always to find the best, most efficient, most elegant solution*.
So, for example, don't be surprised if there are 4 or 5 implementations the
_*Fibonacci Sequence Generator*_.
