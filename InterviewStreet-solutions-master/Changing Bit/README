Let A and B be two N bit numbers. You are given initial values for A and B, and you should write a program which processes three kinds of queries:

set_a idx x: Set A[idx] to x, where 0 <= idx < N, where A[idx] is idx'th least significant bit of A.
set_b idx x: Set B[idx] to x, where 0 <= idx < N.
get_c idx: Print C[idx], where C=A+B, and 0<=idx<N+1.
Input
First line of input contains two integers N and Q consecutively (1 <= N <= 100000, 1<= Q <= 500000). Second line is an N-bit binary number which denotes initial value of A, and the third line is an N-bit binary number denoting initial value of B. Q lines follow, each containing a query as described above.

Output
For each query of the type get_c, output a single digit 0 or 1. Output must be placed in a single line.

Sample Input
5 5
00000
11111
set_a 0 1
get_c 5
get_c 1
set_b 2 0
get_c 5

Sample Output
100
