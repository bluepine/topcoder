Javascript Tips:

	triple === compares types as well

	falsey: evaluates to false 

	an empty array is falsey

	([]) ==0 true

	.map takes everything in an array, transforms them, and gives back a new array

	switch is like an if statement (with if, else if, else if, else, but you use case)

	jsonp has some downsides: you're writing the info to the page. You can't put, delete, update

	script tags trick by making the browser think it's just some javascript

	"this" refers to that exact object, "self" lets you continue to refer to that same object 
	while inside of a callback or a function executed in a different scope that has its own "this"

	caching: client "get me the leaderboard", server does all the work
	browser cache is up to the browser, but you can tell it when to expire

	VPN: remote access to secure things

	caching levels: browser, edge (wide distribution), 

	rails cache

	reddis--write the code to execute on the server(main task), then
	ask someone who makes sure things are cached correctly
	how do I set it up for caching? To modify how long things
	get cached, you can write code to specify it and it's in the
	"cache control header"
