Interview Practice Problems
==================

Repository of example coding interview problems found through online resources,
Cracking the Code book, mentors and colleagues.

Originally, the repository held  Python based answers but based on demand, it 
has been restructured to include answers to these problems in other languages.

Each file contains a description of the problem/algorithm at the top with
solutions to follow. Some files have multiple solutions and/or variations to
the problem. Format is still being standardized but tests are in process of
being added at the end of the file.

Hackbright students, mentors and others are making contributions to the repository.
Contributions are always welcomed. Please submit to the folder that represents the 
language you are coding in.

An additional resource for interview questions and answers can be found at:
